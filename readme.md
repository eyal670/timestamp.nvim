Here's a draft README.md file for the plugin:

# Timestamp.nvim 

A Neovim plugin to copy or append timestamps.

## What it does

This plugin provides two commands:

- `TimestampCopy`: Copies the current timestamp to the system clipboard
- `TimestampAppend`: Appends the current timestamp to the word under the cursor

## Dependencies

The `TimestampCopy` command depends on the `xclip` clipboard tool.
You'll need to install xclip separately.  

## Installation

### lazy

```lua
use 'username/timestamp.nvim'
```

### packer

```lua
use {
  'username/timestamp.nvim'
}
```

## Commands

After installing, two commands are available:

- `TimestampCopy`: Copies the current timestamp to the clipboard
- `TimestampAppend`: Appends the current timestamp to the word under the cursor

## Keymaps

You can add keymaps to invoke the commands:

```lua
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n', '<leader>tc', '<cmd>TimestampCopy<CR>', {noremap = true, silent = true})
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n', '<leader>ta', '<cmd>TimestampAppend<CR>', {noremap = true, silent = true})
```

This will map `<leader>tc` to `TimestampCopy` and `<leader>ta` to `TimestampAppend`.

## Issues
If you encounter any issues, please create a [new issue].

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or suggestions for the README.
